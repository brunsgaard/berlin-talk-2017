# Features of an end-to-end data science platform

* Python models immediately accessible via standard REST API requests without recoding from their native language.

* Embedding models into production apps is as simple as sending an autogenerated code snippet to your dev team. Embed predictive models in any application capable of making REST API requests.

* Make real-time predictions in low-latency applications or use batch mode for bulk offline scoring.


* Model Versioning and AB testing
* Unit Testing
* Deploy Anywhere (Docker)
* Run, Automate, and Track Data Science
* Bandit centralizes data science work, helping teams schedule remote jobs and track predictive models over time.
* Data Storage
