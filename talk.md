# Agenda

* Our team and the problems we solve

* Going from data to prediction

 * Tools, techniques and processes

 * Magic explain while live coding

* From prediction to production

  * What goes into a hosted model (data, model, api, auth, metric, logging)

  * Where do we put stuff (the model is not part of the release, the model is like data, where should we load it from, s3, local)

  * Version misalignment, warming up the model, replacing a running model.

  * Why docker/kubernetes is a nice fit for the hosting part of this usecase

  * Lets deploy Helges model

* The idea of an end-to-end data science platform

* Conclusions

## An end-to-end data science platform?

# What is “Data Science”?

There is a million defitions of data science, we will use this one

> Data science aims to build systems that support and automate data-driven
> operational decisions. 

Operational decisions are decisions that businesses need to make in huge
numbers, on a frequent and regular basis, that have a direct impact on the
business KPI’s and the outcome can be evaluated in short time scales. 

Examples might be “What is the best price for each single product tomorrow?” or
“What is the optimal amount for each single product for the next order sent to
supplier X?”.

# Features of an end-to-end data science platform

* Python models immediately accessible via standard REST API requests without recoding from their native language.

* Embedding models into production apps is as simple as sending an autogenerated code snippet to your dev team. Embed predictive models in any application capable of making REST API requests.

* Make real-time predictions in low-latency applications or use batch mode for bulk offline scoring.


* Model Versioning and AB testing
* Unit Testing
* Deploy Anywhere (Docker)
* Run, Automate, and Track Data Science
* Bandit centralizes data science work, helping teams schedule remote jobs and track predictive models over time.
* Data Storage

# Build a prediction service!

We can do that, it is super easy :)
